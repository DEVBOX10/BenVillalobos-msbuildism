# Tools
- [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/), for understanding your builds. See [Build Spelunking](../build-spelunking/README.md) for tips on how to use it.
- [MonoDevelop.MSBuildEditor](https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.MSBuildEditor), for quickly navigating through build logic.
- [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases), for examining assemblies. I often use this to look into tasks that run in assemblies I don't own.
